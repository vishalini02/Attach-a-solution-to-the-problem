To design an agent workflow for scheduling meetings, I would break the solution into modular steps with agents handling each task:

Parse User Input

Use an LLM (OpenAI/Groq via LangChain) to extract structured details such as participants, date range, meeting duration, and preferences.

Example: “Schedule a 30-min meeting with the design team next week” 

Check Calendars

Integrate with Google Calendar or Outlook APIs to fetch participant availability.

Use an agent tool wrapper in LangChain to query calendars and return free/busy slots.

Suggest 3 Slots

An agent would process availability data, apply constraints (e.g., working hours, time zones), and propose the top 3 suitable slots.

Output: “Available slots: Tue 10 AM, Wed 2 PM, Thu 4 PM.”

Send Invites

Use calendar API integration to automatically create and send invites with meeting details.

Confirm with the user before finalizing.

Key Tools & Frameworks

LangChain / LangGraph – for agent orchestration and workflow management.

LLMs (OpenAI/Groq) – to parse natural language into structured commands.

Google Calendar API / Microsoft Graph API – for calendar integration.

FastAPI – to expose scheduling as a service.

PostgreSQL or VectorDB (optional) – to store meeting history/preferences for personalization.

Workflow Overview:

1.User Input
2.Parse with LLM
3.Agent queries Calendar APIs
4.Suggest 3 Slots
5.Confirm
6.Send Invites
